Provides interactive visualizations for <b>text classification</b> using the <b>Naive Bayes Classifier</b>​. It aims to demystify the inner workings of the algorithm, enabling users to gain deeper understanding of how it categorizes text documents. It serves as a tool for identifying instances when the algorithm's performance falls short. Frequently, it's quite challenging to pinpoint the reasons behind incorrect classifications, and the decision-making process driving predictions often remains obscured. <b>It offers a window into the algorithm's decision-making process</b>, illuminating these aspects and making them more transparent.
